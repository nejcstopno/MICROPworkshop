## How to prioritize host microbiome members?


Core microbiome members are consistent features of a dataset that are hypothesized to reflect underlying functional relationships with the host. A variety of study-specific approaches used to define the core, which presents a challenge to building a general host-microbiome framework.

Abundance-occupancy distributions, used in macroecology to describe changes in community diversity over space, offer an ecological approach for prioritizing core membership for both spatial and temporal studies. Additionally, neutral models fit to the abundance-occupancy distributions can provide insights into deterministically selected core members.

Through examples we will explore core plant microbiome from abundance-occupancy distributions. Though we focus on examples from the plant microbiome, the abundance-occupancy method can be applied to prioritize core membership for any microbiome.
